### Museum Interactive Expierence

This was completed as my master's capstone project. It was a full stack web application developed for the Niagra Aerospace Museum. Designed primarily to allow museum patrons to complete a scavanger hunt using a smart phone, it also could serve as an inventory system for museum curators as well.

On the patron side, each participant is able to specify a level of difficulty and the length of time, and are presnted with a subset of availble questions based on their choice. To solve each clue the participant would tap their phone on an NFC token nearby each exhibit, and would be presented with immediatge feed back. 

On the Museum Curator side, each curator is able to enter scavenger hunt clues as well as exhibit information. Once an item has been entered intothe system, curators are also able to edit it's information, including marking items as active or not, which indicates if they can be presented to patrons or not.
