### Museum Interactive Expierence

This was completed as my master's capstone project. It was a full stack web application developed for the Niagra Aerospace Museum. Designed primarily to allow museum patrons to complete a scavanger hunt using a smart phone, it also could serve as an inventory system for museum curators as well.

On the patron side, each participant is able to specify a level of difficulty and the length of time, and are presnted with a subset of availble questions based on their choice. To solve each clue the participant would tap their phone on an NFC token nearby each exhibit, and would be presented with immediatge feed back.

On the Museum Curator side, each curator is able to enter scavenger hunt clues as well as exhibit information. Once an item has been entered intothe system, curators are also able to edit it's information, including marking items as active or not, which indicates if they can be presented to patrons or not.

### Financial Literacy Application

This was an application developed at UBHacking, an annual 24 hour hackathon run at the University at Bufalo. My group chose to create a Financial Literacy Application designed to consolidate information that new immigrants may find useful when they arrive in the United States. Such information could include different types of bank accounts and credit cards and how to open them, as well as information related to the FAFSA and other scholarship information.

### Research Project in Cognitive Systems

As part of my undergraduate coursework I was required to complete a research project. My project was in the area of moral psychology, and was focused around how the level of privacy affects a person's altruism. To do so, I coded a variation on the public goods game using python and a framework designed for economic games called oTree.

### Pintos: Simple Operating Systems

As part of a course in operating systems, I developed multiple parts of the [Pintos Operarting System](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos_1.html). Main areas of focus included Scheduling Algorithms, User Argument Parsing, system calls, as well as some basic memory management.

### Lossy Image Compression

This was a project completed in my undergraduate coursework designed to algorithmically change images by partioning images in such a way that the color variablity within each partition is mimial while maintaing color distinction across partitions. To do so each pixel must be looked in withitn a variety of paritions before the program decided the optimal paritions and returned the altered image.
