## Overview

My research mainly lies in the computational social science, natural language processing, and culturally competent large language models domains. I primarily build and apply tools to study identity, culture, and expression. While pursuing my bachelor's degree, I developed a variation of the public goods game and deployed it to collect participant data. More recently, I developed tools to apply Large Language Models, such as Meta's Llama-2, to perform named-individual identification and stance detection on tweets. Currently, I am investigating ways to dynamically extract dimensions of cultures from a given corpus of social media data, and then place an individual within the cultures we have identified. A second part of this investigation is looking into how well LLMs can model these cultures, and respond as if it is a member of that culture.

## Current Projects

My main focus is on culturally competent large language models, which is a research area designed to make sure that LLMs are aware, respectful, and adaptable to a number of different cultural contexts. Currently, my research in this area is still in it's initial stages, but this is an important and growing research area which I believe will yield some very interesting and useful results. 

A second project I am working on is expressions of cultural identity on social media, and how users from different regions express their cultural identity.

## Previous Research Projects

While completing my bachelors degree, I had the opportunity to volunteer as a research assistant in the [Center for Applied Moral Psychology](https://sharifflab.com/) under the supervision of Dr. Azim Shariff and Dr. Joe Green. In this project, I developed a variation of the public good game using the oTree framework and python. Once built I deployed it to collect data from participants and wrote a report on my findings, which can be [read here](documents/Caceres-Wright_undergrad_capstone.pdf).
