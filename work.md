#### Graduate Research Assistant, University at Buffalo. June 2023 - Present

I have been working with the Computation and Equity (cUBe) Lab, which is directed by Dr. Kenneth Joseph. The primary focus of my research has been to develop tool for automatic stance detection using Large Language Models. A secondary goal of this project was to create a tool which takes in a large (several million) number of tweets and a small set of keywords and provides a set of similar tweets.

Recently part of our work was accepted, in the form of an extended abstract, to the 10th International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2), which will occur in July 2024.

#### Member Service Represenative, Lockport Family YMCA. September 2023 - Present

As a member service representative, I ensured all YMCA members were greeted on entry to the facility and ensured their needs were met. Along with this, I answered phone calls and kept up to date with all relevant programs, events, and procedures to be able to answer any questions and register members for special events and programs.

#### Teaching Assistant, University of British Columbia. January 2020 - December 2020.

I worked as a teaching assitant for CPSC 210: Software Construction for three semesters. The primary aspects of my job were holding office hours, running labratories, and mentoring a group of roughly 30 students each semester while they developed a personal projects. Topics covered in the course included topics such as class inheritence, exception handling, testing, as well as design patterns such as the observer and iterator.
