#### Data and Analytics Intern, S-cubed: Strategic Sustainability Solutions. September 2024 - Present

I am interning at [S-cubed: Strategic Sustainability Solutions](https://www.scubed-sustainability.com/), where I am analyzing financial and environmental to identify sustainable and profitable business practices. My work is done primarily in python using software packages such as pandas and matplotlib.

#### Graduate Research Assistant, University at Buffalo. June 2023 - Present

I have been working with the [Computation and Equity (cUBe) Lab](https://cse.buffalo.edu/cubelab/), which is directed by Dr. Kenneth Joseph. Currently, I am currently working on comparing various ways individuals reacted to Bernie Sanders dropping out of the 2020 Democratic Primary (and thus the race for president as a whole). Along with this, I am investigating the emergence, engagement with, and discussions of conspiracy theories online.

Previously, I developed tools for automatic stance detection using Large Language Models. A secondary goal of this project was to create a tool which takes in a large (several million) number of tweets and a small set of keywords and provides a set of similar tweets.

Various aspects of our work will appear in the following conferences:

* A paper in the proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Social Computing, Behavioral-Cultural Modeling & Prediction and Behavior Representation in Modeling and Simulation (SBP-BRiMS), September 2024. **[Runner Up, Best Student Lead Paper Award](documents/2024_SBP-BRiMS%20Award.pdf)**
* An extended abstract and poster at the 10th International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2), July 2024.

#### Member Service Representative, Lockport Family YMCA. September 2023 - May 2024

As a member service representative, I ensured all YMCA members were greeted on entry to the facility and ensured their needs were met. Along with this, I answered phone calls and kept up to date with all relevant programs, events, and procedures to be able to answer any questions and register members for special events and programs.

#### Student Assistant, University at Buffalo. May 2023 - August 2023

I volunteered as a student assistant in the X-Lab, directed by Dr. Jinjun Xiong. During my time there I conduced a literature review on current research into quantifying interdisciplinarity on various levels of scope such as the author or departmental level. Along with this I helped with the implementation and debugging of code to create a numerical value representing the interdiciplinarity of authors partially based on the simpson's diversity index.

#### Teaching Assistant, University of British Columbia. January 2020 - December 2020

I worked as a teaching assistant for CPSC 210: Software Construction for three semesters. The primary aspects of my job were holding office hours, running laboratories, and mentoring a group of roughly 30 students each semester while they developed a semester long personal project. Topics covered in the course included topics such as class inheritance, exception handling, testing, as well as design patterns such as the observer and iterator.
