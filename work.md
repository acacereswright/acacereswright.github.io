#### Teaching Assistant, University at Buffalo. August 2025 - Present

I am working as a teaching assistant in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, specifically for CSE 421/521: Operating Systems. My duties including holding weekly office hours, grading exams and assignments, and helping students through two projects designed to teach some operating system fundamentals.

#### Graduate Research Assistant, University at Buffalo. June 2023 - Present

I have been working with the [Computation and Equity (cUBe) Lab](https://cse.buffalo.edu/cubelab/), which is directed by Dr. Kenneth Joseph. Currently, I am investigating how people present themselves online, and how this varies across both geographic location and language. From a more technical perspective this involves working how we can extract meaningful and relevant dimensions from text, and how large language models can aid this extraction.

Previously, I developed tools for automatic stance detection using Large Language Models. A secondary goal of this project was to create a tool which takes in a large (several million) number of tweets and a small set of keywords and provides a set of similar tweets.

Various aspects of my work has appeared in the following conferences:

* A paper published in the proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Social Computing, Behavioral-Cultural Modeling & Prediction and Behavior Representation in Modeling and Simulation (SBP-BRiMS), September 2024. **[Runner Up, Best Student Lead Paper Award](documents/2024_SBP-BRiMS%20Award.pdf)**
* A [poster](documents/Ic2s2_Poster.pdf) at the 10th International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2), July 2024.

#### Data Analyst (Intern), s-cubed: Strategic Sustainability Solutions. September 2024 - June 2025

I worked at [s-cubed: Strategic Sustainability Solutions](https://www.scubed-sustainability.com/), an early stage start up. While there, I led data science initiatives focused on quantifying corporate financial resilience to sustainability risks, which was a critical part of the company's initial product launch. I worked directly with C-Suite executives (former Moody's managing directors) to develop innovative methodologies that impacted both analytics and product development.

My key contributions include:

1. Created a dataset of 1.4+ million companies financial data from over 120 different countries, and implemented quality controls on this data
2. Developed matching algorithms to integrate multiple data sources, including emissions and other environmental data
3. Established financial metrics and ratios for analyzing a company's resilience
4. Built models to assess companies' capacity to absorb the cost of external shocks
5. Documented analytical processes and presented findings to the company executive leadership

While I was initially contracted for three months, I was invited to extend my contract based on demonstrated success and valuable contributions.

#### Member Service Representative, Lockport Family YMCA. September 2023 - May 2024

As a member service representative, I ensured all YMCA members were greeted on entry to the facility and ensured their needs were met. Along with this, I answered phone calls and kept up to date with all relevant programs, events, and procedures to be able to answer any questions and register members for special events and programs.

#### Student Assistant, University at Buffalo. May 2023 - August 2023

I volunteered as a student assistant in the X-Lab, directed by Dr. Jinjun Xiong. During my time there I conduced a literature review on current research into quantifying interdisciplinarity on various levels of scope such as the author or departmental level. Along with this I helped with the implementation and debugging of code to create a numerical value representing the interdiciplinarity of authors partially based on the simpson's diversity index.

#### Teaching Assistant, University of British Columbia. January 2020 - December 2020

I worked as a teaching assistant for CPSC 210: Software Construction for three semesters. The primary aspects of my job were holding office hours, running laboratories, and mentoring a group of roughly 30 students each semester while they developed a semester long personal project. Topics covered in the course included topics such as class inheritance, exception handling, testing, as well as design patterns such as the observer and iterator.
